Requirement Analysis

Main target
* console game for max 3 players including 1 bot
* tests (test folder)
* explanation how to run the code (readme.md)
* some kind of short documentation (requirement analysis)


Conditions for ending the game
* all fields are set - draw
* diagonal set with the same symbols
* complete row set with the same symbols
* complete column set with the same symbols


Class Game
* its the game itself
* will be created by 3 main inputs (playfield (max 1), player (max 3 including 1 AI), symbols (max 3))
* randomly selects a player that starts with the first move
* adds the given symbols to the given player
* controls the moves of the player
* gets the input of the player and sets the symbol in the playfield
* validates user input
* controls the auto movement of the bot player
* prints the current playfield to the console
* determines the winner and quits the game


Class Player
* its the player of the game
* type human or AI
* has a symbol
* has a name


Class Playfield
* its the playfield of the game
* generates the playfield with the given size
* prints the playfield to the console
* set symbol to given position of the player in the playfield
* validate postions
* validate if all poitions are set
* validate if game is over / won
* find empty position on playfield for auto moving the bot


Design decisions
I decided to create these 3 classes, because i think these are the 3 main "busines domains" in this scenario.
We have a game that is played on a playfield by players.
On the otherside, deviding this game into 3 pieces (classes) allows me to handle business logic and tests
seperate from each other.
So it is also possible, that in a team, more than one developer could work on the project at the same time.
